# DEPRECATED: Cron jobs have been replaced by Celery tasks
# See fishauctions/celery.py for the Celery Beat schedule configuration
# See auctions/tasks.py for the task implementations

# To manage periodic tasks in production, use django-celery-beat's admin interface
# or configure them in fishauctions/celery.py
